## 407.- 50 Projects 50 Days - Split Landing Page

### What was the project about?

The project is part of the 50 Projects in 50 Days with Brad Travesy via Udemy. The course is a code-a-long to further cement skills used within HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This particular project was a split landing page. Depending on which side the user hovered on, that side of the landing page would expand to take up 75% of the viewport.

#### CSS

This was a very heavy CSS dependent project. However, nothing new was added to the learning. The project used a couple of transform and transition effect. It used a `::before` effect in regards to the colour overlay.

In addition was class specificity. Instead of adding new classes, by using class specificity, could manipulate the styling a lot easier and clearer. Again, this is something I need to continue to learn and use.

#### JavaScript

This was a rather simple JavaScript project. It only required the `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` method. This method added, or removed, a couple of CSS classes regarding the hover effect.
